# Changelog

Newest first. `tools/release_client.ps1` uses the top section as the release
notes.

## v0.1.36

Q/E relative to the character. Client (the server only for the version).

- In the click scheme Q now means "look to my left" and E "look to my
  right", left and right of where your character is heading (the way it
  is walking, or last moved). The camera steps 90° to the diagonal view
  that brings that side toward the top of the screen, so at a corner the
  passage on that side comes into view, whatever view you started from.
- A/D still turn the camera in the screen's sense, for free sweeping.

The server must be updated to v0.1.36 too, as it refuses any other version.

## v0.1.35

A/D feel; Q/E back. Client (the server only for the version).

- **Q/E** step 90° to the next diagonal view again in the click scheme
  (400 ms), alongside A/D.
- **A/D** turn at 180° a second while held.
- **Letting go of A/D** carries on to the next diagonal view the way you
  were turning if you went more than 10° past the last one, and goes back
  otherwise. The settle starts at the speed you were turning and slows to
  a stop, so the camera never halts and starts again on release.
- The WASD scheme is unchanged; its up/down middle drag still springs back.

The server must be updated to v0.1.35 too, as it refuses any other version.

## v0.1.34

Click scheme camera on WASD. Client (the server only for the version).

- **W/S** tilt the 3D camera while held, between 40° and 85° (near
  top-down), slowing into either end. It stays where you leave it and is
  saved; the camera pulls back a little as it tilts up.
- **A/D** turn the camera while held; let go and it eases onto the
  nearest diagonal view over 250 ms (the saved view is always one of
  those).
- **A middle click** levels the tilt back to 50°.
- Q/E and middle-button drags do nothing in the click scheme now.
- The WASD scheme is unchanged.

The server must be updated to v0.1.34 too, as it refuses any other version.

## v0.1.33

Pitch peek. Client (the server only for the version).

- Hold the middle button and drag up or down to tilt the 3D camera from
  its usual 50° toward top-down (85°), further the further you drag (all
  of it over 300 px), while it pulls back a little to show more round you.
  Let go and it springs back over 250 ms. The camera's turn never changes.
- The click scheme's sideways middle-drag peek is gone; Q/E still turn.
- In the WASD scheme a middle drag turns the camera if it first moves
  sideways and tilts it if it first moves up or down.
- Near walls stay see-through while tilted. F3 shows the pitch.

The server must be updated to v0.1.33 too, as it refuses any other version.

## v0.1.32

Peek in the click scheme. Client (the server only for the version).

- Hold the middle button and drag sideways to turn the 3D camera up to
  45° either way from the view it rests on; let go and it springs back to
  that view over 200 ms. The saved view never changes. Q/E still step
  between views, even mid-peek.
- The WASD scheme is unchanged.

The server must be updated to v0.1.32 too, as it refuses any other version.

## v0.1.31

The 3D camera rests only on diagonal views. Client (the server only for
the version).

- The four resting yaws are the diamond views: the default and each 90°
  from it.
- Q/E step 90° from one to the next in one smooth 400 ms ease, through
  the axis-aligned view without stopping there.
- In the WASD scheme a middle drag still turns freely while held, and on
  release settles on the nearest diamond.
- The saved yaw is always a diamond; an axis yaw saved by an older build
  is read as the nearest diamond.

The server must be updated to v0.1.31 too, as it refuses any other version.

## v0.1.30

Deploys. Tooling only; no game change.

- `deploy.sh` removes untracked `.uid` and `.import` files before it
  pulls, and runs the headless import after the pull, never before. The
  v0.1.29 deploy stopped on a `.uid` the box had generated itself.
- `ship.ps1` cleans the same way before its own pull on the box, and
  before committing imports headless and refuses a script that has no
  `.uid`, so each `.uid` goes in with its script.

The server must be updated to v0.1.30 too, as it refuses any other version.

## v0.1.29

Control schemes as complete packages. Client (the server only for the
version).

- **Click is the default again** (`controls=click`, or no line): click
  and hold-to-move, Q/E turn the 3D camera a step, the verbs land on what
  you click. WASD and the middle button do nothing, and the camera just
  follows you, with no lean toward the cursor.
- **WASD** (`controls=wasd`): WASD walks relative to the camera, the mouse
  aims, a middle-button drag turns the 3D camera freely and settles on the
  nearest 45° step when you let go (eased over 250 ms). Q/E do nothing.
- **The camera never turns under a held movement key**: a drag made while
  you walk applies when you let go of the keys.
- **The WASD lean** now comes from where the cursor is on the screen: past
  a dead zone of 15% round the middle it leans up to 3 cells toward that
  side, settling in about 300 ms. The camera moving cannot change it.
- **The hover and the click always agree**: the cell under the cursor is
  picked once a frame after the camera has moved, and a click goes to the
  cell the square showed.
- The HUD shows only the active scheme's controls.

The server must be updated to v0.1.29 too, as it refuses any other version.

## v0.1.28

Controls pass. Server and client.

- **Two control schemes.** `controls=wasd` (the default) or
  `controls=click` in `settings.cfg`; `--controls=` overrides it for a run.
- **WASD** walks relative to the camera (W is up the screen at the current
  yaw), eight directions from key combinations; letting go stops on the
  cell being entered. Clicking a far cell walks there until a key is
  pressed.
- **The mouse aims** in WASD: standing still you face the cursor; a left
  click attacks whoever is next to you that way, or swings at air; a
  right click grabs whoever is next to you that way, and a drag tosses. A
  click on a sprite still goes to that sprite.
- **Continuous motion.** The player walks at 4 cells a second, steadily,
  with no pause at cell boundaries; monsters and companions are drawn the
  same way. A refused step eases to a stop. Facing turns smoothly (about
  100 ms) toward where you are going, or toward the cursor.
- **The camera leads toward the cursor**, up to 3 cells, and settles back
  on you when the cursor comes back near you. The middle-button peek and
  nudge are gone: Q/E is the only camera rotation.
- **Bumping your companion** makes her step aside at once (YIELD), or say
  there is no room; it goes in the party log. A language-model mind gets
  one decision window to do it before the scripted answer applies.
  Clicking her walks into her rather than attacking her.
- **3D:** the hover is a square cell outline; the toss aim is an arrow on
  the floor; speech shows for 4 seconds from the speech message itself;
  lanterns are warm white; creatures have a nose that shows their facing
  and lunge when they swing.
- **Mispredicts fixed.** A move order sent while a step was showing could
  reach the server before it had taken that step, and the server would set
  off from the tile before and go another way. Steering with the button
  held did this constantly in 3D, where the following camera gives a new
  target every few frames. Orders now carry the steps already shown and
  the server walks those first: a steered walk with 50-200 ms of delay
  went from about two mispredictions in ten seconds to none, and a WASD
  walk round a corner shows none at 0, 120 and 200 ms.
- A companion no longer steps aside onto fire.

The server must be updated to v0.1.28 too, as it refuses any other version.

## v0.1.27

The 3D view is the default. Client.

- A client now starts in the 3D view. `--renderer=2d`, or a line
  `renderer=2d` in `settings.cfg`, picks the 2D view; anything else, or
  nothing, is 3D.
- `renderer=` in `settings.cfg` is now honoured (it was ignored, and wiped
  when the file was rewritten on a resize). The command line overrides it
  for that run without changing the file.

The server must be updated to v0.1.27 too, as it refuses any other version.

## v0.1.26

Docs only; no code change.

- docs/decisions.md records each of v0.1.25's architectural choices on its
  own: the authority polls the network itself (37), the server relay is
  off (38), server sends go peer by peer through `Net.sendable_peers`
  (39), departures come from `Net.peer_left` (40).

The server must be updated to v0.1.26 too, as it refuses any other version.

## v0.1.25

The max-channels flake. Server and client.

- A peer whose ENet link is closing is dropped from the multiplayer
  before the frame's replication pass, and the server relay is off, so
  nothing is sent into a closing link any more: `Unable to send packet on
  channel 0, max channels: 0` is gone from the network test (six clean
  runs where it failed two or three in six).

The server must be updated to v0.1.25 too, as it refuses any other version.

## v0.1.24

Kit walls back; two-wide corridors.

- 3D: walls, posts, doorway, gate and floor are the Kenney kit's own
  pieces again at the kit's proportions, scaled in height only; the
  flat-colour boxes stay available for interior walls later. Everything
  else from step 2 as it was.
- Map: corridors are two cells wide. The west corridor keeps a single-cell
  dead end at (1..2, 8) as the one chokepoint; the links down to the
  passage and the cells inside the door are two wide, with (3, 13)
  walled on its north so the door is still the only way in.

The server must be updated to v0.1.24 too, as it refuses any other version.

## v0.1.23

3D client, step 2. Client only; `--renderer=3d`.

- Kit mapping: flat stone floor in the 2D floor's green-grey; walls as
  plain boxes in the kit's stone at the kit's 0.5 thickness centred on the
  edge, 3 tall; posts at 0.5; the kit's gate leaf scaled to a doorway of
  jambs and lintel; sun down to 0.1.
- Near/far walls as in 2D: the camera-facing side of walkable cells at
  0.3 alpha, recomputed when the camera yaw changes.
- Orbit: Q/E turn the camera 45° about the player, tweened; a middle
  drag nudges up to 45° and springs back; the yaw persists in
  settings.cfg.
- Picking by ray: entity and door colliders first (Area3Ds, no physics
  bodies), then the floor plane, snapped to the nearest walkable cell.
  Hover ring and click ripple as flat rings on the floor.
- Left click move/attack, right drag shove, hold-to-move, keys 1–4, R, F3,
  F11: the same commands the 2D client sends.
- Speech lines as Label3D above the speaker.
- `--test-yaw=<deg>` test hook.

The server must be updated to v0.1.23 too, as it refuses any other version.

## v0.1.22

3D client, step 1: the room. Client only; opt in with `--renderer=3d`.

- A 3D view of the same client: the test room built from the Kenney
  Castle Kit (floor pieces, narrow wall segments on the edges at 3 units,
  corner posts where walls meet or end, the kit's doorway and door leaf,
  fire as an emissive quad with a light), entities as tinted primitives
  at the scale table with Label3D names, lanterns on players and
  companions, a fixed orthographic camera at 50° matching the 2D diamond.
- The default view is unchanged; the renderer is Forward+ explicitly.
- The kit (CC0) ships in `art/kenney-castle/`.

The server must be updated to v0.1.22 too, as it refuses any other version.

## v0.1.21

Peek rotation prototype. Client only.

- The projection takes an azimuth, −45..45°: 0 is the 2:1 diamond view,
  ±45 the axis-aligned view. Floor, walls, doors, ripples, the hover cell
  and every sprite anchor follow it; sprites stay upright and sort by
  projected depth. Near/far walls are classified from the azimuth.
- Middle-button drag turns the view, the full range over about 400 px,
  eased near the limits; release swings it back over 200 ms.
- F3 shows the angle. `--test-azimuth=<deg>` test hook.

The server must be updated to v0.1.21 too, as it refuses any other version.

## v0.1.20

Translucent near walls. Client only.

- Every wall is full height; the occlusion windows and the stub rule are
  gone.
- Walls on the south or east edge of a walkable cell (facing the camera)
  draw at `Main.NEAR_WALL_ALPHA` (0.3); walls on north or west edges draw
  opaque. Interior partitions follow the cell they are the south or east
  edge of.
- Near walls draw as one layer with a single alpha, so where they overlap
  on screen they never stack toward opaque.
- A 1 px darker line along every wall top and up every corner, at the
  wall's alpha.
- Door posts follow the edge they stand on; the panel stays opaque.

The server must be updated to v0.1.20 too, as it refuses any other version.

## v0.1.19

Occlusion windows. Client only.

- Every wall stands full height; the stub rule is gone.
- A creature (player, companion, monster) behind a wall face shows
  through a soft circular window in it, a tile across, centred on its
  sprite: the face fades to 25% at the centre and back to opaque at the
  edge, animating in and out over 150 ms as the creature passes. A
  shader per face, up to eight windows each.
- Doors are unchanged.

The server must be updated to v0.1.19 too, as it refuses any other version.

## v0.1.18

Window and resolution. Client only.

- The project is laid out at a 3840×2160 base viewport (canvas_items
  stretch, expand, hidpi): one to one on a 4K monitor, half-scale at
  1080p. The world and the UI look as before.
- First launch is a resizable 1920×1080 window. F11 toggles borderless
  fullscreen at the monitor's native resolution.
- The windowed size and the mode are kept in settings.cfg (window_width,
  window_height, window_mode) and restored on the next launch.
- Entity name and speech captions are rasterised sharp at the camera zoom.
- `--test-fullscreen=<seconds>` test hook.

The server must be updated to v0.1.18 too, as it refuses any other version.

## v0.1.17

Movement feedback. Client only.

- A move click ripples at the target cell: a ring on the floor, a step
  lighter than the floor, grows from 4 px to a tile across over 250 ms
  and fades. One per click; holding the button retargets as the cursor
  crosses cells, each new cell with its own ripple. The hover highlight
  stays on the cell under the cursor.
- A click off the floor (void, past a wall) goes to the nearest walkable
  cell within three tiles of the click point and ripples there; further
  out it is ignored.
- A click on an entity sprite targets that entity with either button,
  whatever cell is under the pixels.
- `--test-click=<seconds>` test hook.

The server must be updated to v0.1.17 too, as it refuses any other version.

## v0.1.16

Quiet walls. Client only.

- Every wall face is one flat neutral grey (`Main.WALL_VALUE`, 0.18),
  darker than the floor and a few steps above the void, the same whichever
  way it faces: no lit side, no gradient, no blue tint.
- No lit top strip and no end faces; the top of a wall is where the face
  ends. Corners get a 1 px line one step darker than the face.
- No shaded floor beside walls: the floor is one surface up to the wall
  base and stays the brightest thing on screen.
- Stubs follow the same rules at their height. Doors are unchanged.

The server must be updated to v0.1.16 too, as it refuses any other version.

## v0.1.15

Low walls wherever floor is behind them. Client only.

- A wall is a stub whenever a full-height one would hide floor: any
  walkable cell straight behind it within six cells counts, void cells
  between skipped. The walls on the near side of the old thick wall rows,
  which stood full and hid the room behind them, are stubs now. Only walls
  with nothing behind them stand full.

## v0.1.14

- stub rule: south/east edges of walkable cells are stubs

## v0.1.13

Wall tops that join, doors with height. Client only.

- Wall top strips are 4 px ribbons that miter at corners, run through at
  a T with the joining wall butting in, and end square at a free end with
  a short end face. Stubs get the same at their height.
- Doors stand at full wall height between two jamb posts, with a panel
  that swings; a closed door reads as a door, not a plank.
- Outside the map is near-black instead of wall grey.
- The path preview is gone; the hover highlight stays.
- A half-wall off the chamber's north wall, between (5, 1) and (6, 1).

The server must be updated to v0.1.13 too, as it refuses any other version.

## v0.1.12

Walls and picking: thin walls, low near walls, ground-plane clicks, a
path preview. Client only.

- Walls are drawn on the cell boundary with no footprint: a face and a lit
  top strip. Floor draws fully to the base of its walls.
- Walls in front of a floor cell (its south and east edges) are low stubs;
  walls behind stand full height. The fade-to-black ring and the see-through
  wall effect are gone.
- Clicks and hover resolve to the floor cell under the cursor on the
  ground plane; walls, doors and tall sprites never intercept a move. The
  hover highlight shows the target cell even behind a tall wall. A right
  click still picks a sprite to shove, and a door face to open or close
  it from beside it.
- A faint dotted path from you to the hovered cell, through any door on
  the way; it disappears on click.

The server must be updated to v0.1.12 too, as it refuses any other version.

## v0.1.11

Walls on edges, and a door.

- Walls are now the edges between cells, not cells of their own: corridors
  are one cell wide with walls on their sides, the passage two cells with
  walls on the outside. Moving, pushing, sight and melee all respect the
  edge between you and where you are going; diagonals cannot cut a wall
  corner. A body pushed against a wall edge stops there and takes impact as
  before.
- One door, on the south exit of the chamber. Click it from beside it to
  open or close it, or just walk through: creatures open doors on their
  way, monsters included, unless someone stands in the doorway. A crate
  cannot pass a closed door. A door takes impact like a wall and, being
  wood, breaks once its hp is spent.
- Walls are drawn as thin tall faces on the cell boundary with posts at
  ends, corners and door jambs; a face over your own cell fades while it
  covers you. Doors swing open.

The server must be updated to v0.1.11 too; the map format changed.

## v0.1.10

Scale and space pass, placeholder art only.

- Everything drawn has a size in tile heights, from one table: characters
  1.5, walls 3, crates 0.8, barrels 0.9, the boulder 1.2.
- Walls are continuous blocks with a top face; straight runs, corners and
  end caps come from their neighbours. A wall that would hide something
  turns translucent while it does. The floor in front of a wall is shaded.
- The map is 48Ã—36. The room you know is one chamber in it; two corridors
  lead off it, east and south, and bend out of view.
- The camera follows your player with a little lag, and everything beyond
  about 12 tiles fades to black.
- Nothing else: no lighting, no tileset, no sprites.

The server must be updated to v0.1.10 too (the map is server data).

## v0.1.9

No more rubber-banding into a crate that cannot move.

- Clicking a crate that is against a wall (or heavier than you can push,
  or backed by other crates with nowhere to go) made your capsule bounce
  between you and the crate for as long as the order stood. The client now
  applies the same push rule as the server before showing a step, so the
  walk stops beside the crate. The server was never moving you, which is
  why nothing else reacted.
- When the server has given a move order up (a refused step into the
  destination, or no reply at all), the client stops predicting it instead
  of guessing again.

This is a client-only fix, but the server must still be updated to v0.1.9
to accept the client.

## v0.1.8

Anyone can reset the room.

- Press R to rebuild the room from the map: monsters, crates and the
  boulder back in place, dead companions back beside their owners, players
  where they stood. It used to work only when hosting, never on the
  dedicated server. The server logs who did it.
- This is on while the game is being tested; a server started with
  `--no-player-reset` keeps resets to its console.

The server must be updated to v0.1.8 too.

## v0.1.7

Companions come back where their owner is.

- A companion brought back by `reset` was put on its owner's last saved
  tile even when the owner was moved to a safe start tile, which could
  leave it alone among the monsters, out of sight. It now always appears
  beside its owner. The same goes for a living companion whose saved tile
  has a monster within 5 tiles.
- `reset` now says which companions it brought back, or that none were
  dead.

The server must be updated to v0.1.7 too.

## v0.1.6

Smooth movement for everything you do not control, and a way to get a dead
companion back.

- Monsters, companions and other players moved in hops on a client: half a
  tile slid, the rest jumped, then a pause; companions and players simply
  jumped from tile to tile. They now slide evenly, as on a host.
- A companion that died was gone for good. Rebuilding the room (`reset` on
  the server console, or R on a host) now brings dead companions back, at
  full health, beside their owners.

The server must be updated to v0.1.6 too: it refuses clients of any other
version.

## v0.1.5

Fixes a server looking different from a fresh room after an update.

- A server that restored its saved world kept the looks of the build that
  saved it: white crates and a square boulder, where a fresh room had tan
  crates and a round one. Level entities now take their shape, colour, size
  and mass from the current map on every start, and only their position and
  health from the saved world.
- Crates and the boulder saved by an old build keep their place in the
  level, so a second copy no longer respawns on their original tile.

## v0.1.4

Fixes the client closing a few seconds after connecting.

- A client and server built from different code now refuse each other with
  a "build mismatch" message instead of the client crashing. The 0.1.3
  client did exactly that against a newer server.
- Player names show over their capsules, like companions' names.
- Coming back or respawning never puts you next to a monster: if one is
  within 5 tiles you appear on the safest start tile instead. For the first
  3 seconds, or until you move or attack, monsters leave you alone and your
  capsule is drawn faded.
- Companions: the join log now says what happened to yours (new, waiting for
  you, or died earlier). The language-model mind talks to Ollama's native
  endpoint with reasoning off.
- Entities are built from one generic scene, so new kinds of things can be
  added on the server without a client update.
- The boulder is now round.

## v0.1.0

First playable build.

- Isometric grid sim at 10 Hz: eight-direction movement, walking pushes,
  force pushes with impact damage, stun on collision, fire tiles, stamina
  that fades knockback as it runs down.
- Click to walk or attack, right click to shove, drag to toss in a chosen
  direction, including over your own head.
- Multiplayer over ENet with a dedicated Linux server, client-side
  prediction, join tokens, and a world snapshot that survives restarts.
- Self-updating Windows client: `launch.bat` checks GitHub for a newer
  release before starting the game.

# Changelog

Newest first. `tools/release_client.ps1` uses the top section as the release
notes.

## v0.1.12

Walls and picking: thin walls, low near walls, ground-plane clicks, a
path preview. Client only.

- Walls are drawn on the cell boundary with no footprint: a face and a lit
  top strip. Floor draws fully to the base of its walls.
- Walls in front of a floor cell (its south and east edges) are low stubs;
  walls behind stand full height. The fade-to-black ring and the see-through
  wall effect are gone.
- Clicks and hover resolve to the floor cell under the cursor on the
  ground plane; walls, doors and tall sprites never intercept a move. The
  hover highlight shows the target cell even behind a tall wall. A right
  click still picks a sprite to shove, and a door face to open or close
  it from beside it.
- A faint dotted path from you to the hovered cell, through any door on
  the way; it disappears on click.

The server must be updated to v0.1.12 too, as it refuses any other version.

## v0.1.11

Walls on edges, and a door.

- Walls are now the edges between cells, not cells of their own: corridors
  are one cell wide with walls on their sides, the passage two cells with
  walls on the outside. Moving, pushing, sight and melee all respect the
  edge between you and where you are going; diagonals cannot cut a wall
  corner. A body pushed against a wall edge stops there and takes impact as
  before.
- One door, on the south exit of the chamber. Click it from beside it to
  open or close it, or just walk through: creatures open doors on their
  way, monsters included, unless someone stands in the doorway. A crate
  cannot pass a closed door. A door takes impact like a wall and, being
  wood, breaks once its hp is spent.
- Walls are drawn as thin tall faces on the cell boundary with posts at
  ends, corners and door jambs; a face over your own cell fades while it
  covers you. Doors swing open.

The server must be updated to v0.1.11 too; the map format changed.

## v0.1.10

Scale and space pass, placeholder art only.

- Everything drawn has a size in tile heights, from one table: characters
  1.5, walls 3, crates 0.8, barrels 0.9, the boulder 1.2.
- Walls are continuous blocks with a top face; straight runs, corners and
  end caps come from their neighbours. A wall that would hide something
  turns translucent while it does. The floor in front of a wall is shaded.
- The map is 48×36. The room you know is one chamber in it; two corridors
  lead off it, east and south, and bend out of view.
- The camera follows your player with a little lag, and everything beyond
  about 12 tiles fades to black.
- Nothing else: no lighting, no tileset, no sprites.

The server must be updated to v0.1.10 too (the map is server data).

## v0.1.9

No more rubber-banding into a crate that cannot move.

- Clicking a crate that is against a wall (or heavier than you can push,
  or backed by other crates with nowhere to go) made your capsule bounce
  between you and the crate for as long as the order stood. The client now
  applies the same push rule as the server before showing a step, so the
  walk stops beside the crate. The server was never moving you, which is
  why nothing else reacted.
- When the server has given a move order up (a refused step into the
  destination, or no reply at all), the client stops predicting it instead
  of guessing again.

This is a client-only fix, but the server must still be updated to v0.1.9
to accept the client.

## v0.1.8

Anyone can reset the room.

- Press R to rebuild the room from the map: monsters, crates and the
  boulder back in place, dead companions back beside their owners, players
  where they stood. It used to work only when hosting, never on the
  dedicated server. The server logs who did it.
- This is on while the game is being tested; a server started with
  `--no-player-reset` keeps resets to its console.

The server must be updated to v0.1.8 too.

## v0.1.7

Companions come back where their owner is.

- A companion brought back by `reset` was put on its owner's last saved
  tile even when the owner was moved to a safe start tile, which could
  leave it alone among the monsters, out of sight. It now always appears
  beside its owner. The same goes for a living companion whose saved tile
  has a monster within 5 tiles.
- `reset` now says which companions it brought back, or that none were
  dead.

The server must be updated to v0.1.7 too.

## v0.1.6

Smooth movement for everything you do not control, and a way to get a dead
companion back.

- Monsters, companions and other players moved in hops on a client: half a
  tile slid, the rest jumped, then a pause; companions and players simply
  jumped from tile to tile. They now slide evenly, as on a host.
- A companion that died was gone for good. Rebuilding the room (`reset` on
  the server console, or R on a host) now brings dead companions back, at
  full health, beside their owners.

The server must be updated to v0.1.6 too: it refuses clients of any other
version.

## v0.1.5

Fixes a server looking different from a fresh room after an update.

- A server that restored its saved world kept the looks of the build that
  saved it: white crates and a square boulder, where a fresh room had tan
  crates and a round one. Level entities now take their shape, colour, size
  and mass from the current map on every start, and only their position and
  health from the saved world.
- Crates and the boulder saved by an old build keep their place in the
  level, so a second copy no longer respawns on their original tile.

## v0.1.4

Fixes the client closing a few seconds after connecting.

- A client and server built from different code now refuse each other with
  a "build mismatch" message instead of the client crashing. The 0.1.3
  client did exactly that against a newer server.
- Player names show over their capsules, like companions' names.
- Coming back or respawning never puts you next to a monster: if one is
  within 5 tiles you appear on the safest start tile instead. For the first
  3 seconds, or until you move or attack, monsters leave you alone and your
  capsule is drawn faded.
- Companions: the join log now says what happened to yours (new, waiting for
  you, or died earlier). The language-model mind talks to Ollama's native
  endpoint with reasoning off.
- Entities are built from one generic scene, so new kinds of things can be
  added on the server without a client update.
- The boulder is now round.

## v0.1.0

First playable build.

- Isometric grid sim at 10 Hz: eight-direction movement, walking pushes,
  force pushes with impact damage, stun on collision, fire tiles, stamina
  that fades knockback as it runs down.
- Click to walk or attack, right click to shove, drag to toss in a chosen
  direction, including over your own head.
- Multiplayer over ENet with a dedicated Linux server, client-side
  prediction, join tokens, and a world snapshot that survives restarts.
- Self-updating Windows client: `launch.bat` checks GitHub for a newer
  release before starting the game.

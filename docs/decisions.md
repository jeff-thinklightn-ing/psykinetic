# Decisions

Short record of choices that are settled. Add new entries at the bottom; if one
is reversed, say so in a new entry rather than editing the old one.

## 1. 2:1 isometric at 32×16

Tiles are 2:1 diamonds, 32 px wide by 16 px tall (TileSet: isometric,
diamond-down). All art, grid ↔ screen math (`sim/iso.gd`), and the
TileMapLayers assume this size.

## 2. GDScript

All game code is GDScript, targeting Godot 4.7 APIs (`TileMapLayer`, typed
dictionaries). No C#, no GDExtension.

## 3. Host-authoritative discrete grid sim, no continuous physics

The game state is a grid: every entity occupies exactly one tile, and `World`
owns the tile → entity map. Movement is whole-tile steps through
`World.try_move`. There are no physics bodies, no collision shapes, and no
continuous positions in the sim; on-screen motion is interpolation only.

The host is the single authority. All state mutation is gated behind
`multiplayer.is_server()`, from the start, even though there is no networking
yet.

## 4. 10 Hz tick

The sim advances at a fixed 10 ticks per second, independent of frame rate.
Durations in the sim (move time, attack cooldown) are counted in ticks.
Rendering interpolates between ticks.

## 5. Eight directions, uniform step cost, no wall corner-cutting

Entities move in eight directions and a diagonal costs the same ticks as an
orthogonal step. A diagonal may not pass between tiles where either orthogonal
neighbour is a wall; passing between two entities is allowed.

## 6. Pushes: mass decides if, force decides how far

Whether a push moves anything is decided by mass alone: the mover's mass is a
budget spent by each body it sets in motion. How far a body goes and how hard
it lands is decided by force, scaled by `mover_mass / body_mass` clamped to
0.5–1.5. Leftover force becomes impact damage. The push code has no
per-entity-type branches; `body_material` decides what damage means.

## 7. Hits resolve after everyone has acted, in entity id order

Attacks and shoves are queued during the act phase and resolved afterwards in
ascending attacker id. A hit whose target is no longer where it was aimed is
dropped, never re-aimed.

## 8. Diagonal steps take 1.5× the ticks (reverses the cost half of 5)

Uniform step cost made sideways movement on screen nearly twice as fast as
any other direction, and paths that mixed diagonal and orthogonal steps
visibly lurched. A diagonal step now takes `ceil(move_ticks × 1.5)` ticks
(`World.DIAGONAL_TICK_SCALE`), and A* is costed in ticks. Set the constant to
1.0 to get uniform cost back. The corner-cutting rule in 5 is unchanged, and
force pushes are unaffected: force is still counted in tiles.
